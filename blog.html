      i think it's only fair to dedicate my first blog post to one of the greatest professors i've had the privledge of crossing paths in DMD. his name is adam scott and if it weren't for him, this webpage would not be happening right now! i always thought there was so much to coding and learning how to create a webpage, but there really isn't! it's just a matter of putting some fear aside and actually going for it. it's funny because after a while you're using shortcuts like [command + option + .] to close a tag and you don't even realize it! i've learned so much about HTML and CSS, i'm actually interested in and very excited to take advanced web design next semester. i just hope the professor is as helpful as adam, i really appreciated his patience throughout the semester and although i wasn't in his classes as often as i wish i was...
      <br>*note to self: stop taking 6 classes every semester and trying to intern, it's H-A-R-D!
      <br>i am very thankful to have met him and learned some new skills. i've always wanted to launch my own blog, so now i have no more excuses! the only person holding me back is myself, because i've got the tools to create a blog - now i just to find the courage to actually create one. i'm using this webpage as motivation to finally crossing that goal off my to do list. as you can see, i have designed this webpage in a way that could possibly work for a blog, there's a lot more tweaking that needs to be done to it, but for now... I'M SO FREAKING PROUD OF IT! stay tuned peeps, you're in for an exciting journey with me. and once again, thank you adam for showing me the tools to start this journey and for a great semester! good luck to you on your life journey as well :)
